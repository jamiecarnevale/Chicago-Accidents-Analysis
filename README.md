# Chicago Accidents ML Modeling

Author: Jamie Carnevale

## Overview

Hello Chicago Traffic Safety Board! We have creeated a classifcation model to predict the primary contributory cause of a car accidents.

## Business Understanding

Modeling for primary contributory causes of car accidents can help us identify areas in which we can make the most difference in reducing the amount of car accidents.

## Model Classification Target Groups

In order to create this model, we binned the the primary causes for accidents into four different categories: reckless driving, missed or misunderstood traffic signs or rules, issue with driver or vehicle, and external variable.

Some of the subcategories that fall under these four main categories include:
- Reckless driving: following too closely, improper overtaking/passing, texting,  failing to reduce speed to avoid crash
- missed or misunderstood traffic signs or rules: disregarding yield sign, disregarding traffic signals, disregarding stop sign, failing to yield right of way
- issue with driver or vehicle: driving skills/knowledge/experience, physical condition of driver, had been drinking
- external variable: weather, animal, distraction from outside vehicle, vision obscured, road construction
